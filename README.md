# Haskell-RSA
A command-line interface for encryption, decryption, and key generation. This is a Haskell implementation of [Textbook RSA](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1448/definition-of-textbook-rsa "Crypto StackExchange"). The interface is written using a simple bash script which calls the executables compiled from Haskell.
